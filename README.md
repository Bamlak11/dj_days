# DJ Days README

Welcome to **DJ Days**, a dynamic single-webpage application designed to bring music lovers and collectors a virtual DJ booth at their fingertips. **DJ Days** allows users to see which album is currently playing, browse through a comprehensive list of albums, add new albums to their collection, and select any album to be the "now playing" music. 

## Features

- **Now Playing Display**: The top section of the app showcases the album that is currently playing, displaying its cover art, title, and artist.
- **Album List**: A comprehensive list of all albums available in your collection. Users can scroll through and select any album to play next.
- **Add New Album**: Users can add new albums to the list by entering the album's details, including its title, artist, and cover art URL.
- **Dynamic Selection**: Click on any album from the list to make it the "now playing" album, updating the display automatically.

## Technologies Needed

- **HTML**: To structure the content of your application, providing the framework for the dynamic features to come alive
- **CSS**:To style your application, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive user interface
- **JavaScript (JS)**: To power the interactive features of the app, such as adding new albums, selecting an album to play, and dynamically updating the now playing display
- **JSON**: To store the list of albums, making it easy to add, retrieve, and update the collection. This project will need a `albums.json` file that serves as the initial database for the application.
